			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p class="body">EngPlay is a termly theatre production put on by the
				University of Waterloo Engineering Society. With auditions open to
				anyone and everyone, the play changes frequently in both
				scope and topic. Some shows have been written by the directors for the
				term, while other shows have been purchased scripts from professional
				playwrights. There has been the occasional musical,
				but all EngPlay's share a common theme: laughter. We love goofing
				around and having a good time and getting people to join in on
				the fun with us. The production can change drastically from night
				to night based on improv, audience interaction, and last-minute plot
				twists. EngPlay is a tradition shared amongst many schools, and one
				that sits close to Waterloo’s heart.</p>

			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p class="body">I was contacted by Engplay's directors to design a poster
				for their upcoming play satirically titled "The Planet of the Arts".
				What was initially supposed to be a Saturday evening job quickly turned
				out to be the complete marketing of the play, design of the logistic,
				art direction and branding.</p>

			<h2>Poster Design</h2>

			<p class="body">
				The university of waterloo is flooded with posters, how do we make our
				stand out? I decided to follow the following criterion to achieve </p>

				<ul>
					<li class="body">
						Clever/memorable idea skinned with nice aesthetics.
					</li>
					<li class="body">
						Intriguing 15 metres away as it is 5 centimetres away.
					</li>
					<li class="body">
						Builds curiosity and enables the viewer to follow up.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Brand Design</h2>

			<p class="body">To make a theatre production more attractive and modern
				to the millennial, The logo of Engplay needed to look casual and
				friendly. So a cursive, serif typography was chosen. </p>

				<div class="image row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12">

			<h2>Web Design</h2>

			<p class="body">
				I also helped to design and code their website from scratch. We knew
				that most people coming to the site would be from seeing the poster.
				The posters are a key part of the site, they communicate the identity
				of the event. I made sure that the UI was such that it would match any
				future posters. The site is designed to be fully responsive, this was
				possible using grid layout. <a href="http://uwengplay.com">Click here</a> to visit the site.

			<h2>Self Critique</h2>
			<p class="body">EngPlay sold 400% more tickets compared to previous years.This was very enriching and practical application
				of the purchase funnel but there could be some improvement in knowing where did our audiance learn about us. For example
				a form could have been used at purchase stage to learn more about how did the audiance learned about EngPlay.<p>
