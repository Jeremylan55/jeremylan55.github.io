            <p class="body">During my time at Shopify, I got the opportunity to
              work with the Home team on the admin dashboard. I was in charge
              of several aspects of the Home page from redesigning key UI
              elements to implementing new ones. I also led stakeholder meetings
              to clearly communicate the design goals and specifications to PMs,
              developers, content strategists and designers, making sure the
              projects were aligned with overall strategy and product direction.
              I got the opportunity work extensively on the visual design,
              product design, information architecture and content strategy of
              Home.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Merchant Goals</h2>
            <p class="body">Every day half a million merchants go to their home
              page to plan their day. Some of those merchants have full-time
              jobs and have very little to spare on their store while others
              consider their shop as the one and only source of revenue. Those
              merchants have very specific needs. They are definitely not your
              common social media users! They look for tangible content that
              will impact their store.</br>
              Home delivers this content through actionable cards that that are ranked by a
              recommender system. </br>The following design
              principles help Home to always benefit the merchants.
            </p>
            <ul class="body">
              <li>Home guides where work is to be done, work is not done on Home.</li>
              <li>Guide and teach the merchant on the best course of action.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Home for the Holidays</h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul class="body">
              <li>Identifier for holiday cards helps the user recognise related content easier.</li>
              <li>Differentiate between holiday vs not holiday content.</li>
              <li>Communicate the theme of the content with minimum reading.</li>
              <li>Drive users to relate web services useful for the holiday season.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Identifier Exploration</h3>
            <p class="body">Diverging thinking and converging thinking are used
              at this stage. At the diverging stage, the aim is to go as far as
              possible within the constraints of the project. Thinking expansively
              help in gathering the required context. The process involved gathering
              imagery about holidays and creating a mood sheet to guide exploration.
              Here are visual explorations created in the diverging stage.

                    <div class="caption align-centre">Identifier alternative designs</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p class="body">The Home page of admin droved 40% of the traffic to the Holiday toolbox over the month of december.
              This helped countless merchants plan for the Holiday season in North America and and get the best out of it in
              term of sales.

            <h2>Home Notifications </h2>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul class="body">
              <li>Alert user of important issues concerning the state of their store.</li>
              <li>Clearly explain the type and urgency of the issue.</li>
              <li>Be able to dismiss notifications where it is possible to clear the feed.</li>
              <li>Make the merchant aware of the consequences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p class="body">Not every notification deal with the same type of
              issue, some issues can be only informative while others might be
              very urgent like a payment transaction failing. The notifications
              can be organised into different tiers and escalate to another
              higher tier if necessary.
            </p>

            <div class="image row">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <img src="img/notif_ia.png" alt="">
                    <div class="caption align-centre">Notification IA</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Exploration</h3>
            <p class="body">Exploring multiple concepts helps in strengthening
              my understanding of the problem. Common themes such as layering
              complexity and association are reflected in the alternatives solution.
            </p>

            <div class="image row">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <img src="img/notif_exploration.png" alt="">
                    <div class="caption align-centre">Notification alternative designs</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p class="body">A/B test showed that 14% of the users closed irrelevant and resolved notifiactions.
              This helped in reducing the number of support tickets.

            <h2>Home Blog Cards Redesign</h2>
            <p class="body">Reading through user feedback, I noticed that the
              blog cards were polarising among the users, some really learned a
              lot from the articles while others found them very distracting.
              Word count pointed out that 45% of those that had negative
              opinions on the matter, though that they were "spams".
            </p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul class="body">
              <li>Show value and time investment in reading the blog.</li>
              <li>Make blog cards less distracting to the workflow of merchants.</li>
              <li>Convey trustworthiness of content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bringing More Value Beyond the Software to Merchants.</h3>
            <p class="body">New merchants that just began their journey with
              Shopify face many difficulties at the beginning. The milestones
              are to drive traffic to their store, having their first sale and
              eventually making more sales. We use our knowledge of what
              merchants need along their journey to tailor the right content
              to them.
            </p>

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-6 col8sm-offset-1set-2 col-xs-12">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
            <p class="body">To build thrust into the content, the latter needed
              to be short and precise surfacing the value to the merchant
              quickly and effectively.
            </p>

            <div class="image row">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <img src="img/content.png" alt="">
                    <div class="caption align-centre">Content strategy of blog cards</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p class="body">The idea or reduction of redundant content was kept from the previous version and it was chosen that only 2 articles would be shown in the feed by the recommender system.<br>

The final design polished the drawback of the previous version by using illustrations to increase scanability and while the content was, even more, streamline to only 3 components. First, one is a reason why we show this to the merchant to increase trust in the recommender system. The second piece of content would be a curated title specially for the card as sometime article would have too long titles. The third piece of content is the amount of time needed to be invested by the busy merchant reading the article.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="body">During my time at Shopify, I learn to sharpen my
              skill in visual and product design. I also got the opportunity to
              also work on the information architecture and content strategy of
              Home. I learn a lot about how merchants deal with their business
              and the challenges they face on a day to day basis. I will be
              eternally grateful to my mentor Jordan and my teammates.
