            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="body">Fall 2016 was spent at Boltmade (acquired by shopify), a consulting firm that
                specializes in software design and development. Everything at boltmade
                is vertically integrated, boltmade helps small startups to
                large multinationals to build their product from scratch or add value
                to their service through design thinking.</p>
            <p class="body">My roles at boltmade involved designing features, creating
                 the visual identity of clients products and performing user
                 research/testing to make sure that the product succeeds.</p>

            <h2>Design goals</h2>
            <p class="body">My job as a designer at Boltmade was to transform the
            design of the MVP into a robust, scalable and adaptive product
            for mobile tablet and desktop.</p>


            <h3>To create consistent experience across platforms</h3>
            <p class="body">
            To reach the largest market possible and work on the different
            platforms the operators uses Cirro 2.0 was designed to be adaptive
            to multiple screens and hardware. E.g: phone, tablet, desktop.
            </p>
            <h3>To create patterns easily recognizable by the users</h3>
            <p class="body">
                Display relevant information for pilots that are critical at each stage in the user flow. Red routes were defined
                at the project kick-off so that to prioritize where to improve the usability of the product.
                For examples: Creating a new flight report is directly available on the dashboard or 3 clicks away from
                anywhere in the software.
            </p>

            <h3>To make the product completely touch and click friendly.</h3>
            <p class="body">
                The UI components were designed with the human factor in mind from the
                beginning. E.g : Buttons are at least 10mm on screen and reducing mouse
                travel on desktop.

            <h3>Be easily recognised and identifiable. </h3>
            <p class="body">
                Thought Cirro provide immense value to its users with its inconsistent visual identity users can not easily recognize it and talk about it to potential new users.

                In the aircraft industry, there are a lot of compliance software for different hardware. Not following common UI interactions will make it harder for users to quickly adopt new complex features.

            <h2>Research</h2>

            <p class="body">It was crucial for to identify the target users and
                experience their daily routine by visiting a few small to medium aircraft operators.
                There I interviewed multiple employees ranging from Administrators,
                Pilots, field engineers to executives and perform a diary study
                to determine their needs and frustrations.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="body">Arm with all the knowledge I was able to brainstorm with
                    the team to produce several potential user flows. Those proposals went
                    through a rigorous selection by Boltmade and the client.The chosen one was used for the next stage of the design process</p>

            <p class="body">I decided to identify the common interaction patterns that

                    I used the atomic design principle to build the UI components of Cirro.
                     I started by defunding the Typography, text fields and buttons to make sure that redesign was extremely structured and provided the building blocks for future features. Those parts were assembled to
                      create different components which enable a wide variety of actions
                        but remain familiar to the users.</p>

            <p class="body">
                A critical part was to ensure that the product worked as predicted and
                is a joy for users to use. I crafted the wireframes using "Sketch" and
                "Pixate" to seek initial feedback internally and eventually moved
                to test it with a few pilots. For this process, we mostly used
                A/B testing strategy to determine the best solution.</p>

                    amount of time that I had the prioritization of task helped me deliver in a timely manner.</p>

                I made a design guideline for Cirro so that future developers or
                designers can create features at a faster rate and have the resources
                to maintain a consistent visual identity and experience in the future
                product. Before the company was to join Shopify, hand-off documents
                e.g: sticker sheets were given to our client.
