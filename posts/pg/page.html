			<h2>DESIGN BRIEF</h2>
			<p class="body">REDLab is the innovation lab of Manulife found at
				Communitech. The REDLab's duty is to explore the possible applications
				of emerging technologies to improve financial services. Every sprint
				the lab designs and develops a solution to a problem faced by clients.

			<p class="body">One sprint I decided to tackle the issue that,
				many new parents of the early 2000's have the belief that their
				children are too frivolous and do not understand the value of money.
				Though a diary study among several parents, we found out that many
				children are not aware how to save because their parent rarely trusted
				them with money. The children are also easily tempted to spend their
				money impulsively. We explored how gaming and constant encouragement
				will help to change the children's habits and build trust with
				their parents.</p>

			<h2>Personas</h2>
			<p class="body">The challenge we faced was to have access to the demography
				 we were interested in. We performed interviews at libraries and places
				 where families can be found. After 50+ interviews, we defined our
				 user's personas below.</p>

			<h2>MOOD SHEET</h2>
			<p class="body">I identified popular games and educational apps for 7-10 years olds. Below are a mood sheet and interaction templates common in those apps. We found that UI components are very large to make it accessible for the children. Also, made affordance of the buttons very clear by making them very responsive. We found that most of the gameplay was revolved around an avatar.</p>

			<h2>GAME FLOW</h2>
			<p class="body">The main challenge was to make the saving process for
				children stimulating. The gameplay would encourage them at milestones
				by awarding with items that they can use to customise their piggy bank.
				Providing rewards will stimulate them to continue toward their goal.</p>

				<p class="body">One key feature we introduced was the ability for
					parents to give "Virtual" money to their children and rewarding
					them with the actual funds when they reach their goals. This
					would create trust between both users.</p>

			<h2>Characters</h2>
			<p class="body">The game needed an avatar for the players. A piggy bank
				was chosen as the avatar because children's easily associate it
				with saving money. </p>

				<p class="body">Below are tentative sketches and different kind of
					avatar ,the solution could use. We took heavy inspiration from
					"Alphabear" to make the piggy bank. The cube shape enabled
					it to be customisable.</p>
