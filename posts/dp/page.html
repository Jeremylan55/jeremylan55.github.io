			<h2>DESIGN BRIEF</h2>
			<p class="body">Mobile gaming has exploded the past few years. My interest
				 in this field grew while I was getting more exposure to the latter.
				 This project serve as an learning and experimental excercise about games
				 designed especially for mobile devices. Those games often rely on very
				 simple interactions to let users play. The objective was to design a
				 "one tap" game from start to finish and pick up as much asknowledge
				 as possible on the way.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Player motives</h2>
			<p class="body">Players that would be targeted are casual mobile gamers.
				Those players often play when they have small gaps in their busy agenda.
				 Their free time is often scarce, They need to be able to quickly start
				 a session and end it. Often they will start playing in public transit
				 because it is one of the few times of the day that they are free.</p>
				 <p class="body">This brings up the need to design a game that is very simple and highly
					 comfortable to play with one hand in shaky environments such as the
					 subway. This is where knowing the most accessible touch areas is
					 very important. The picture below describes the most comfortable
					 areas in green. So we will be expecting the player to touch the
					 screen in those green areas.
				 </p>

				<div class="image row">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
						<img src="img/thumb-zones-lineup.png" alt="">
						<div class="caption align-centre">Touch screen heat map</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="body">Furthermore, the hand of many of our users may cover
					part of the screen. It is important to take into consideration this
					factor while laying out the visuals.

			<h2>PLAYER FLOW</h2>

					<img src="img/flow_diagram.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="caption align-centre">Flow diagram</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p class="body">Players need to be able to play again with minimal
				navigation. The chosen design consist of a closed loop that navigates
				between the result screen and the game scene. The player can play
				indefinitely while using only the simplest interaction possible which
				is tapping on the screen.</p>

			<h2>CHARACTER DESIGN</h2>

			<div class="image row">
				<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
					<img src="img/characters.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="caption align-centre">Characters silhouette test</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p class="body">Several designs of the character were made. The one with
				the most distinguishable silhouette was chosen. To help immerse our
				players in the game, the character needed to seem alive. The most
				effective and clear way to express the sense of life was to make the
				character go through three stages of life. The being birth, living and
				then death. Below you can see the models of those 3 stages</p>

			<h2>SCENE DESIGN</h2>

			<p class="body">The screen needed to communicate to the players.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="body">The medium
					<p class="body">From the start, once the player taps the screen,
						the character is born and start moving. This tells the player that
						tapping on screen cause the character to move. Moving is the medium.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="body">The obstacles.
					<p class="body">The player can immediately see that the part of the
						ground is lava denoted in orange. The same visual style is used to
						represent the falling meteor so that the player can identify the
						latter as an obstacle.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="body">The game objective
					<p class="body">The objective is communicated by having the fruits to
						be of the opposite colour to the obstacles.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="body">The picture below shows the role of each part of the UI.</p>

			<h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>

			<p class="body">This project helped me to develop my coding abilities and
				learning how to use unity engine for the first time. The models were
				made using MagicaVoxel and then animated in Maya.</p>

			<h2>SELF CRITIQUE</h2>

			<p class="body">Transposing my skills in 2d to 3d was very enriching and
				designing for elements that are not flat can be challenging. The 3d
				content needed  to reflect behiour of physical object to communucate
				intent to player. Animation can take a lot of time and may lose scope
				of design. Exagerating propostions to make the character more
				visible on small screens.</p>
