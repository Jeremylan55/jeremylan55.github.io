			<h2>DESIGN BRIEF</h2>
			<p class="body">Wheelo is an app that let University of Waterloo and
				Laurier students plan and travel at a low price in between Cities.</p>
			<p class="body">During the winter of 2017, I lead the UX, visual design,
				user research and product roadmap of Wheelo. The main objectives for the
				 MVP of Wheelo were to make the process of finding a carpool in only a
				 few taps and to build our user base as quickly as possible. Therefore
				 a multiplatform app was needed, both for iOS and Android.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="container-960 animated fadeInUp">
			<div class="divider"></div>
			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p class="body">The first step was to determine what was the struggles
				and how did people found carpools. It was also crucial to determine the
				level of difficulty at the touch points of the current process.
				I create an online form that would take only a few minutes to fill and
				posted it on social networks to understand real users. The gif below
				shows the questionnaire used.</p>
				 <p class="body">Base on the generous data I received, the user's
					 journey map with critical touchpoints was created. The diagram below
					 shows the touchpoints that create the most friction as orange peaks.
					 This helped me to prioritise the problems and determine the
					 objectives and constraints that the app needed to achieve.
				 </p>

				</div>

				<p class="body">The personas of our users where synthesise to help us
					remind ourselves of the problems that our users were facing and always
					 design a feature with them in mind. Wheelo has 2 types of users,
					 driver and passengers. The personas below shows one fictitious user
					 from each group.
				</p>

					<h3>Emily: Passenger</h3>
					<p class="body">Bio
						Profession: Undergraduate student</br>
						Location: Toronto</br>
						Type: passenger</br>
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						Background</br>
						Emily is an undergrad student from University of waterloo. She
						rents an apartment with other classmates in the surroundings of
						the university.  She has courses through Monday to Thursday and
						prefers to return home in Toronto on Thursday and come back to
						waterloo on Sunday evenings. She usually either share a ride with
						her friend or looks for a carpool.
					</p>

					<p class="body">
						Motivations</br>
						She chooses to carpool for the time saved in doing so. She always
						looks for the option which is cheaper and requires less effort.
					</p>

					<p class="body">
						Frustrations</br>
						She finds it hard to go through a dozen or poorly written post to
						find the one that she is interested in.  The time spent looking
						for a matching carpool is a downer for her and prefers to ask a
						friend first.
					</p>

					<h3>Kevin: Driver</h3>
					<p class="body">Bio</br>
						Profession: Undergraduate student</br>
						Location: Toronto</br>
						Type: driver</br>
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						Background</br>
						Kevin a graduate student of waterloo. He is doing research for
						the university. He lives alone and has a car that he uses
						regularly to got to school and drive home during the weekends.
					</p>

					<p class="body">
						Motivations</br>
						He thinks about saving a bit of cash when he drives home by
						 driving other carpoolers. He wants to get people quickly and
						 regularly. To be able to do so he was to be able to post his
						 ad quickly and easily.
					</p>

					<p class="body">
						Frustrations</br>
						He always posts on multiple pages weekly. He thinks that
						needing to repost or rewrite is a waste of time.
					</p>

			<h2>DESIGN</h2>

			<p class="body">Sticking to the click mentality, the focus was to design
				the search bar that let them find their carpool with the less amount
				of input. The diagram below demonstrates the logic map to achieve
				the minimum amount of steps to find a carpool.</p>

				<div class="image row">
					<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
						<img src="img/logic_diagram.jpg" alt="">
						<div class="caption align-centre">logic diagram</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="body">After determining the logic of the app, I designed how
					the user would interact with the app. To achieve this I start by doing
					 rough sketches of the states of the different screens required.
					 Below is the chosen paper prototype for the app.</p>

					 <div class="image row">
	 					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
	 						<img src="img/paper_prototype.jpg" alt="">
	 						<div class="caption align-centre">Paper prototype for the Home screen and search bar</div>
	 					</div>
	 				</div>

			<h2>VISUAL LANGUAGE</h2>

			<p class="body">The next step involves fleshing out those concepts into a
				tangible and coherent tool. To achieve this, I designed the iconography
				and typography following a strict code. For example, the icons in the
				app were made using the icon grid principle that enables irregular
				shapes to fit pleasantly and have the same weight on screen.
				Furthermore to inject a bit of personality to the icons so that users
				can always recognise Wheelo, was to give them a rounded edge on
				one side only.</p>

				<div class="image row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12">
						<img src="img/icon_grid.jpg" alt="">
						<div class="caption align-centre">Icons designed using grid to normalise visual weight</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="body">In designing the onboarding, this style can also bee
					seen in the illustrations. The illustrations' colours were restricted
					to the current palette of the app and where made using simple
					juxtapose geometry to make them highly rememberable. </p>

			<h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>

			<p class="body">
				A high fidelity prototype was made using sketch and illustrator.
				To communicate the designs properly with the rest of the team, I used
				"Marvel" to show the user flow and "Zeplin" for dimensioning.

			<h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>

			<p class="body">Due to tight deadlines and the need for use to reach the
				largest amount of users, we used Ionic framework for developing a
				cross-platform product. I got the opportunity to work with this tool
				and sharpen my skill with angular and web mobile frameworks.</p>

			<h2>SELF CRITIQUE</h2>

			<p class="body">A lot of time spent to in exploring different alternatives for the search bar with is a critical feature. This can linger and delay development. I also was able to empathise with the pain of the developers when translating mocks to code when we need to support every screen size..</p>
